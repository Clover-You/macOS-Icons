<h1 align="center">Hi folks!</h1>

In this repo you'll find free-to-use app icons, document icons and Pixelmator templates that I've made.<br>
Every assets is in its relative folder. The document icons that I've reworked are for IINA, Keka and VSCode (or any IDE, since they're not branded).

My icons are now officially used in IINA and TomatoBar! &nbsp; ðŸŽ‰
