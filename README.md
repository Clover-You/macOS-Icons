<h1 align="center">macOS Icons</h1>

Hi folks! Here you'll find free-to-use app icons, document icons and Pixelmator templates that I've made.<br>
The document icons that I've reworked are for IINA, Keka, VSCode/VSCodium & CodeRunner â€• or any IDE, since they're not branded (in case you want to use them with other IDEs, I advice to choose the CodeRunner one, since it's more complete).<br>
You can also find my app icons on <a target="_blank" href="https://macosicons.com/#/u/Zabriskije">macOSicons</a>.

Officially used in BTTV for Safari, IINA, Mochi Diffusion, Spamify and TomatoBar &nbsp;ðŸ¥³
